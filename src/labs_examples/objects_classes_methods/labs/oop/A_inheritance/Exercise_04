Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

Answer: it will print "Child called", because the instance of 'c' is of type Parent but due
to polymorphism will call the overridden method in Child, unlike in exercise 2 where a variable was called.
You would need to call the super method inside of the overridden method "super.doSomething()" to also
get the "Parent called" printed



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
