Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?
Answer: "Parent called \n Child called"
When constructors are called, the parent class is called first and then the child class,
so there is no need to call the super class within the child class constructor (well,
no need to call the child constructor in the parent constructor since the parent is
called first with constructors)



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
