/**
 * Conditions and Loops Exercise 1: Even or Odd
 *
 *      Write a program that gets a number between 1 and 1,000,000
 *      from the user and determines whether it is odd
 *      or even using an if statement. Print the result.
 *
 *      NOTE: We will be using the Scanner class to collect user input. This is demonstrated below.
